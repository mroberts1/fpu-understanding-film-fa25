## Policies & Procedures

### How to do well in this class

Attend all scheduled classes.

Be on time. Don't leave early.

Complete all reading assignments **before** the scheduled class.

Watch all assigned films.

Take notes. The Cornell note-taking system is recommended. If you don't take notes during class, you will forget 90% of what was discussed there. 

Use a free note-taking app like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and learn how to write in Markdown format. 

Ask questions. These should be academic (i.e. related to course topics and materials) rather than administrative (due dates, rubrics etc.).

Administrative questions should be asked outside class, either in person after class or via Canvas Inbox.

### Attendance

Attendance of all scheduled classes is mandatory. Attendance is taken at the beginning of class; if you arrive late, you may miss rolecall, in which case remember to ask to be recorded as Late after class.

### Punctuality

Class begins at 10:50 a.m. and ends at 12:05 p.m. Be sure to arrive in time for the beginning of class. Class does not end until students are dismissed: please do not leave early. Arrival after 11 a.m. will be recorded as Late (L), and three Late count as one Absence. If you need to leave early, please notify me of this before class as a courtesy.

### Absences

You are permitted up to two (2) Excused absences, and a maximum of four (4) absences for any reason.

If you reach 4 absences, you are required to arrange a meeting with me to discuss your status in the course.

### Excused/Unexcused Absence

Absences are recorded as Excused (E) in case of health, emergency, bereavement, professional development (e.g. job interview), or participation in a University sports team. For more than two (2) absences in case of health issues, a doctor's note is required. All other absences are recorded as Unexcused (U).

### Sports Teams

If you are unable to attend a class due to attending sports events, you are required to email me a list of dates when you expect to be absent. After the missed class, you are required to schedule a meeting with me during my office hour (Thursday 9:30-10:30) to discuss what was missed during your absence.

### Communication

Please use Canvas Inbox for all course-related questions. Other questions can be sent via email ([robertsm@franklinpierce.edu](mailto:robertsm@franklinpierce.edu)). I try to reply to direct messages within 24 hours (except on weekends), and will expect you to do the same.

### Notifications

It is strongly recommended to disable notifications on Canvas. 

## Classroom Protocol

### Food and Drink

You may bring a drink to class, but please do not eat when class is in progress.

### Sleeping in class

You are expected to remain alert and attentive at all times during class. If you fall asleep during class, you will receive an informal verbal warning. If the problem recurs, you will receive a second written warning. If the problem continues after this, it will significantly affect your Engagement grade for the course (20%). 

### Cellphones

The use of cellphones during class is strictly forbidden.

### Headphones

The use of headphones or earbuds during class is strictly forbidden 

### Laptop Privileges

The use of laptops or tablets (e.g. iPads) is permitted during class for taking notes ONLY. Any other use is unauthorized, and if detected will result in the withdrawal of your laptop privileges for the remainder of the semester. This means that you will be required to take notes by hand with pen and paper from that point on.

### Timeouts

Since this is a short class (1.25 hrs), you are expected to remain present in class throughout except in case of emergency. Please do not keep walking in and out of class. This applies particularly when screenings are in progress.

### Hoods

Hoods must be worn **down** at all times. This is so that I can see at all times that you are not using headphones (see above). Room temperature does not require wearing of hats or other headgear.

### Warnings and Engagement Grade

Non-compliance with the above policies will result in an initial verbal warning.

If the non-compliance continues, I will request a meeting with you to discuss the issue, and it will impact your Engagement grade (20%).
